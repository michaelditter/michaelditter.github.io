More than 80% of executives believe AI leads to a competitive advantage, while 79% feel it increases productivity, according to a recent PWC study. But the question is, how can businesses strategically tap into the untapped potential of AI?\n\n## **1. Understanding Your Business Model**\n  \nBefore you can even begin to think of integrating AI into your business model, it's crucial to **comprehensively understand your organization's processes, objectives, and future outlook**. Implementing AI is not about replacing human intelligence, but augmenting it to achieve optimized results.\n\n**Unilever**, the multinational consumer goods company, is a perfect example of this. Its AI-driven \"People Data Center\" actively learns from internal and external data, providing insights into customer preferences and market trends, thus aiding in shaping marketing strategies.\n\n## **2. Identifying Opportunities for AI Integration**\n\nOnce you have attained a deep understanding of your business model, the next step is pinpointing areas that can benefit most from AI implementation. These might include customer interactions, operations, logistics, or any other segment where automation, prediction, or enhanced decision-making could help the organization.\n\nFor instance, **UPS uses AI and Machine Learning (ML)** for predictive analytics that optimize routes for its fleet, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year. Likewise, **Goldman Sachs** leverages AI in risk assessment and fraud detection, enhancing their services and saving resources.\n\n## **3. Building a Multifunctional AI Team**\n\nNext, you need to bring together a team with the diverse skills to handle the AI implementation. This team should be composed of **data scientists, data engineers, AI specialists, business analysts, and domain experts**. The amalgamation of these diverse talents ensures that the AI solutions are not only technically sound but will also deliver meaningful business results.\n\nConsider the journey of **Netflix**. A good blend of engineers, data scientists, and business analysts has allowed them to develop AI algorithms that recommend movies and shows based on individual user\u2019s preferences. This strategic use of AI has substantially reduced churn and improved customer retention.\n\n## **4. Choosing the Right AI Tools and Platforms**\n\nThere is a vast array of AI tools and platforms available in the market, both open-source and proprietary. It's essential to choose the ones that align with your business objectives, have excellent community support, and offer scalability as your AI initiatives grow.\n\nCompanies like **IBM, Google, and Amazon** provide AI platforms for businesses. They offer comprehensive services designed to assist with everything from data collection to model deployment. Just remember that the best tools or platforms must align with your business needs, it's not always about choosing the most advanced or expensive one. \n\n## **5. Monitoring and Measuring the Success of AI Implementation**\n\nThe bulk of your work may be done, but remember to constantly monitor and measure the success of your AI implementation. This can be challenging since the effects of AI might not be immediately apparent, and also the metrics differ from one business context to another.\n\nConsider **Salesforce\u2019s Einstein AI**, a success story of effective AI implementation. Salesforce monitors AI-powered predictions and recommendations, continually measures the models' accuracy, and makes necessary tweaks.\n\n# **Conclusion**\n\nIn summary, effectively wielding the powerful tool of AI requires thorough planning and understanding. AI's potential is immense, but to harness it, businesses must take a tailored approach that aligns AI initiatives with business objectives, diligently identifying opportunities, assembling the right team, selecting suitable tools and regularly monitoring outcomes.\n\nBusinesses should not view AI as a universal panacea but should approach it as a strategic transformation partner. As the landscape continues to evolve, it's vital to remember that AI is a journey, not a destination. The need of the hour is to continue learning, experimenting, and adapting AI strategies to realize your business\u2019s full potential. \n\nAs we move into an AI-infused future, businesses that successfully incorporate AI into their strategies will be the ones leading their respective industries. It is not a matter of 'if' but 'when\u2019 AI becomes a ubiquitous part of our everyday business strategies. \n\nNow, the real question is, when are you integrating AI into your business?\n\n**- Michael J Ditter, Director of AI Strategy and Emerging Technology at Diageo**",
